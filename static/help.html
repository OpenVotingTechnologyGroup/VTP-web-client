        <h3>The VoteTrackr+ Guarantee:</h3>
        <p><b><ul><li>VTP will validate that every ballot has been recorded and tallied correctly with a
            verifiable guarantee</li>
            <li>Every voter can validate their per contest votes on their own smart devices, executing
                the same tallies that election officials can execute, watching their specific votes as
                well as all the votes get counted</li>

            <li>VTP accomplishes this by:
                <ol><li>creating special cryptographic records</li><li>giving back to
                    the voter a personal BUT ALSO anonymous ballot receipt by which the voter can validate
                    their contest votes and their tallies</li></ol></li></ul></b></p>

        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>This is a simulated demo of a public election integrated with VoteTrackr+ (VTP) as a fully
            open source plug-in to existing proprietary electronic voting technologies.  VTP
            can secure and protect traditional paper based elections, mail-in ballot elections of many types,
            as well as online internet based voting with or without paper based ballots.  VTP can insure
            elections of all types.  See <a href="overview.html">Overview</a> for more background info.</p>

        <p>VTP individually validates and guarantees that every ballot has been recorded and tallied
            correctly.  Every voter can validate their ballot choices on their own smart devices,
            executing the same tallies that election officials execute, watching their and all the votes
            get counted correctly.</p>

        <p>VTP accomplishes this creating a cryptographic records and given back the voter a personal but
            also anonymous ballot receipt containing such records by which the voter can validate their
            vote and its tally.</p>

        <h3>Demo Explanation - how this works and how to vote:</h3>
        <h4>1) Voting</h4>
        <p>In this demo, you will be able to vote in five contests:
            <ol>
                <li>U.S. President</li>
                <li>U.S. Senate</li>
                <li>County Clerk</li>
                <li>Athletic Director</li>
                <li>Question 1 - should the starting time of the annual town meeting be moved to 6:30 PM?</li>
            </ol>
            Of the five contests, the second contest, <i>U.S. Senate</i>, is a Rank Choice Vote (a.k.a.
            Instant Runoff Vote) contest.  In this contest you can select up to all the contestants
            in a rank order.  You can rearrange them after selection by dragging and dropping.</p>

        <p>At the top of each contest there is a progress bar that allows you to jump directly to different
            contents or go back and revisit previous ones.  The last page is a checkout page where you can
            review your selections and potentionally change them.</p>

        <h4>2) Casting your ballot</h4>
        <p>Once you have completed your ballot and are on the checkout page, you can either spoil it
            to start again or cast it by
            selecting the <b>VOTE</b> button.  Once clicked, the VTP server will crypographically generate
            a plethora of cryptographic records and when done, will return a personal <b>AND
            ANONYMOUS</b> ballot receipt.</p>

        <p>The ballot receipt will monitarily display the single row index in the ballot receipt that is
            yours.  Please remember this row number.  Once it disappears it is gone from the VTP system.
            The other rows in the ballot receipt are random other contest votes.  Each column is a
            different contest.  In other words, each entry in the ballot receipt table is effectively a
            contest vote.</p>

        <p>Normally, the tallies are not available until after all the polls close <i>even with VTP</i>.
            However, since this is an introductory demo, this specific demo as been modified so that the tallies are
            constantly available.  In addition this demo has also been modified so that your specific ballot
            is more or less tabulated as it is cast.  Normally ballots are randomized in time to
            isolate the casting time and order from the the tabulation order.  It is not the case
            with this demo - you will be able to see the tabulation of your ballot within a few moments
            of casting.</p>

        <h4>3) Verifying your ballot and the tally</h4>
        <p>To verify your specific ballot, click the row number in the ballot receipt that was
            momentarily displayed at the top of the ballot receipt page.  If you have forgotten your
            row number, it is fine if you go back and vote again.</p>

        <p>With your ballot verication page showing, you can click on the cryptographic digest associated
            with your contest vote to go to the Cast Vote Record (CVR) of your actual contest vote.  From
            there you can click on the tally and review the tally for that contest, witnessing your
            vote be counted.  If the contest is a RCV contest, you may see your vote get re-cast to
            another candidate if your first/current choice candidate has lost a RCV counting round.</p>
