        <h3>The VoteTrackr+ Guarantee:</h3>
        <p><b><ul><li>VTP will validate that every ballot has been recorded and tallied correctly with a
            verifiable guarantee:</li>
            <ul><li>each voter receives an anonymous ballot receipt with 100 rows of randomized ballot records and secretly receives their unique row number</li></ul>
            <li>Every voter can validate their per contest votes on their own smart devices, executing
                the same tallies that election officials execute, watching their specific votes as
                well as all the votes get counted</li>
            </ul></b></p>

        <h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>This is a simulated demo of a public election integrated with VoteTrackr+ (VTP) as a fully
            open source plug-in to existing proprietary electronic voting technologies.  VTP
            can secure and protect traditional paper based elections, mail-in ballot elections of many types,
            as well as online internet based voting with or without paper based ballots.  See <a href="overview.html">Overview</a> for more background info.</p>

        <p>VTP individually validates and guarantees that every ballot has been recorded and tallied
            correctly.  Every voter can validate their ballot choices on their own smart devices,
            executing the same tallies that election officials execute, watching their votes get correctly counted.</p>

        <h3>Demo Explanation - how this works and how to vote:</h3>
        <h4>1) Voting</h4>
        <p>In this demo, you will be able to vote in five contests:
            <ol>
                <li>U.S. President</li>
                <li>U.S. Senate</li>
                <li>County Clerk</li>
                <li>Athletic Director</li>
                <li>Question 1 - should the starting time of the annual town meeting be moved to 6:30 PM?</li>
            </ol>
            Of the five contests, the second contest, <i>U.S. Senate</i>, is a Rank Choice Vote
            (Instant Runoff Vote) contest.  In this contest you can select up to all the contestants
            in a rank order.  You can rearrange them after selection by dragging and dropping.</p>

        <p>At the top of each contest there is a progress bar that allows you to jump directly to different
            contests or go back and revisit prior contests.  The last page is a checkout page where you can
            review your selections and potentionally change them.</p>

        <h4>2) Casting your ballot</h4>
            <p>Once you have completed your ballot and are on the checkout page, you can either go back and
            start again (spoil the ballot) or cast it by
            selecting the <b>VOTE</b> button.  Once clicked, the VTP server will generate
            a plethora of cryptographic records and when done, will return a personal <b>AND
            ANONYMOUS</b> ballot receipt.</p>

        <p>The ballot receipt will momentarily display the single row index into the ballot receipt that is
            your vote.  Please remember this row number.  Once it disappears it is gone.
            The other rows in the ballot receipt are random other votes.  Each column is a
            different contest.</p>

        <p>Normally, the tallies are not available until after all the polls close <i>even with VTP</i>.
            However, this specific <i>introductory</i> demo as been modified so that the tallies are
            constantly available.  As a result your specific ballot
            is more or less tabulated as it is cast.  Normally the recording of ballots are randomized
            in time order for greater voter anonymity.</p>

        <h4>3) Verifying your ballot and the tally</h4>
        <p>To verify your ballot, click the row number in the ballot receipt that was
            momentarily displayed at the top of the ballot receipt page.  If you have forgotten your
            row number, in this demo it is fine for you go back and vote again.</p>

        <p>With your ballot verication page displayed, you can click on the numbers associated
            with your contest vote to go to the Cast Vote Record (CVR) of your actual contest vote.  From
            there you can click on the tally and review the tally for that contest, witnessing your
            vote being counted.  If the contest is a RCV contest, you will see your vote get re-cast to
            another candidate if your first/current choice candidate has lost a RCV counting round.</p>
